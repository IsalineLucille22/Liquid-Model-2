# Simulation of bacterial growth in a liquid suspension

## Overview

The different scripts are created in order to simulate mono or co-culture of Pseudomonas veronii and Pseudomonas putida in an homogeneous liquid suspension. With these scripts, you can especially test the effect of initial abundances, growth kinetics parameters and cross-feeding on the stationary state.
